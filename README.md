high availability architecture for cloud environment

the Project Title is: 
Towards an approach to sustain web services high-availability using communities of web services in a CLoud Environment.

Abstract:
In any critical system, high-availability of software components like web services has so
far been achieved through replication.describe for example how many replicas are needed, where to locate replicas, and how replicas interact with the original web service and among themselves if needed. The purpose of this paper is to show how replicates could be substituted with components that are similarly functional to the component that needs back-up in case of failure.

Practical implications: 
The proposed approach has been validated in practice by deploying a TOMP2P-based testbed. The experimental work has implemented the active replication strategy.
